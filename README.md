# 🎭 Live Emotion Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects human emotions in real-time using a webcam.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on facial expression images to classify emotions like **angry, happy, sad, fear, surprise, neutral, and disgust**.

## 🔄 Process Flow (Execution Order)

Follow this order step-by-step:

---

### 1️⃣ Load Dataset

📄 `load_dataset.py`

* Loads images from dataset folders
* Converts images to required format (48x48 grayscale)
* Splits into training and validation

---

### 2️⃣ Check Class Imbalance

📄 `check_imbalance.py`

* Counts number of images per emotion
* Displays imbalance using bar chart
* Helps identify minority classes (like *disgust*)

---

### 3️⃣ Compute Class Weights

📄 `compute_weights.py`

* Calculates weights for each class
* Assigns higher importance to minority classes
* Helps reduce model bias

---

### 4️⃣ Data Augmentation

📄 `data_augmentation.py`

* Applies transformations:

  * Rotation
  * Shift
  * Zoom
  * Flip
* Improves model generalization
* Prevents overfitting

---

### 5️⃣ Build CNN Model

📄 `build_model.py`

* Creates deep CNN architecture:

  * Conv layers (32 → 64 → 128 → 256)
  * Batch Normalization
  * Dropout layers
* Designed for better feature extraction

---

### 6️⃣ Train Model

📄 `train_model.py`

* Trains model using:

  * Augmented data
  * Class weights
* Uses:

  * EarlyStopping
  * ModelCheckpoint
* Saves best model

---

### 7️⃣ Real-Time Emotion Detection

📄 `realtime_detection.py`

* Uses webcam via OpenCV
* Detects face using Haarcascade
* Predicts emotion in real-time
* Displays emotion label on screen

---

## 🎯 Model Performance

* Validation Accuracy: **~56%**
* Dataset: FER-2013 (challenging dataset)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Dataset imbalance (few samples for *disgust*)
* Similar emotions may confuse model
* Accuracy depends on lighting and face clarity

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use Transfer Learning (MobileNet / ResNet)
* Add more training data
* Improve face detection accuracy
* Build UI (Streamlit / Web App)

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Real-time deployment

It is suitable for learning and practical AI applications.
